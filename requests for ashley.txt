## SDK2 runtime access to custom plugin animation frames / atlas image info
- We can set `SetHasAnimations(true)` on the Spriter plugin object type and load atlas PNGs into the plugin's animation frames at import time (editor-side), but at runtime (SDK2) we have not found a documented API on `ISDKWorldInstanceBase` / `ISDKObjectTypeBase` / runtime `IObjectType` to enumerate that plugin object's animation frames (equivalent to legacy `GetObjectClass().GetAnimations()[0].GetFrames()`).
- Current runtime logs show legacy/internal-style access (`GetObjectClass/getObjectClass`) is unavailable in some environments, so self-draw must fall back to loading atlas PNGs from Project Files and slicing via SCON metadata.
- Question: Is there a supported SDK2 runtime API to access a custom plugin's animation frames/image infos for `SetHasAnimations(true)` object types, or is project-file loading the intended approach?
