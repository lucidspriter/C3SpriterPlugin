# Phase 6 â€” Parity and polish

## Goal
Achieve feature parity with the legacy addon, optimize performance, and finalize documentation and samples.

## Checklist
- [ ] Port the remaining actions, conditions, and expressions from the README roadmap, validating against legacy behaviour.
- [ ] Optimize rendering and ticking paths (batching, caching, Construct feature compatibility).
- [ ] Refresh README/docs with SDK v2 instructions and updated example projects.

## Using this file
- Keep a running list of completed API groups or optimization wins beneath the relevant checkboxes.
- Split major efforts (e.g., documentation overhaul vs. performance tuning) into sub-phase files such as `phase-06a-performance.md` and link them below.
- Note any external dependencies or release criteria (e.g., Construct store submission requirements).

## Sub-phases
_None yet. Add bullet links here when you split out deeper work._
