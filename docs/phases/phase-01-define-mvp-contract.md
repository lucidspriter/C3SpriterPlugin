# Phase 1 â€” Define the MVP contract

## Goal
Clarify the minimum behaviour required to "load and display a Spriter animation" using SDK v2, establishing the reference scope for the MVP.

## Checklist
- [ ] Review the legacy runtime under `scml/c3runtime` to list the subsystems needed for loading, ticking, and drawing a single animation.
- [ ] Document the agreed-upon MVP behaviours and required SDK v2 lifecycle hooks in a shared design note (e.g., markdown in `docs/`).
- [ ] Record open questions or missing SDK features in `requests for ashley.txt` with references.

## Using this file
- Update the checklist as you confirm each item. Add short notes or links next to checkboxes if helpful for later phases.
- If the investigation grows, create sub-phase files under `docs/phases/` with a `phase-01x-*.md` naming pattern and link them below.

## Sub-phases
